# Sight Word Learning App

The Sight Word Learning App is designed to help users learn and practice sight words through interactive levels. Each level presents a set of words to learn, and users can navigate through different word lists and levels to enhance their learning experience.

## Getting Started

### Home Screen
- Upon opening the app, you will see the home screen with a title "Word List."
- There are multiple tiles displayed, each representing a different level or part of a level.

### Navigating Levels
- The tiles are color-coded and numbered to indicate different levels.
- Click on any tile to select the corresponding level. For example, click on the tile labeled "1" to start with Level 1, or "11 Part 1" for the first part of Level 11.

### Starting a Level

## Speak Button

### Single Word Practice
